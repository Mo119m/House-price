House price prediction

Motivation: 
We aim to predict SalePrice to make sure that the price we are getting for that particular house is within our expectation. The dataset was collected from 2006-2010 from homeowners in Ames, Iowa. It containes 79 explanatory variables covering location, structure, interior/exterior quality, basement and garage information, and selling details for residential homes in the region.

Variables: 
Since we have 79 variables, we will cut down the number by grouping some variables together, getting rid of some variables, etc. There are 23 nominal, 23 ordinal, 14 discrete, and 20 continuous variables. Here are some of the variables:
Location and lot features (e.g., Neighborhood, LotArea, Street)
House design and structure (e.g., HouseStyle, YearBuilt, RoofStyle)
Interior and utility features (e.g., GrLivArea, FullBath, KitchenQual)
Basement and garage attributes (e.g., TotalBsmtSF, GarageCars, BsmtQual)
Extra amenities (e.g., Fireplaces, WoodDeckSF, PoolArea)
Sale details (e.g., MoSold, SaleCondition)
The target variable is SalePrice, representing the propertyâ€™s final selling price in dollars.
